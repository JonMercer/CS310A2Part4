============

Kuklos is a web service that will allow users to quickly find the locations of Vancouver’s public bike racks using a visual representation powered by Google Maps. Kuklos promotes green practices by making it easier to manage biking around the city. We encourage social change by merging transportation, technology and social networking by partnering with Facebook. 

Additionally, users will be able to view all of the bike racks using a tabular view. Users will be able to register for an account / log in and select their favorite bike racks, and if logged in said bike racks will appear at the top in a different colour. The administrator will be able to have the web service update it’s record of bike racks using a button on his account page. The data will be pulled from Data Vancouver.
